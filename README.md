# GKE UPGRADE SLACK NOTICES
This is a GCP Cloud Function to send GKE auto-upgrade notifications to Slack.

## Documentation
The documentation for this is in a doc string at the top of main.py. This is so
that if this Cloud Function is put in another repository, the documentation
stays with the code.
